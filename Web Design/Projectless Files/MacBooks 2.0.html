            <h1>The Apple MacBook</h1>
            <span>
                <h2><i>The MacBook</i></h2>
                <img src=https://mattraimondi.com/webdesign/img/macbook.jpg width="500px" alt="MacBook">
                <p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">Our goal with MacBook was to do the impossible: engineer a full‑size experience into the thinnest, lightest Mac notebook yet. And not only is it compact — it’s more powerful than ever. The new MacBook delivers up to 20 percent faster performance with new seventh‑generation Intel Core m3, i5, and i7 processors, and up to 50 percent faster SSD storage.<br>&nbsp;</p>

                <h2><i>The MacBook Air</i></h2>
                <img src=https://mattraimondi.com/webdesign/img/macbookair.jpg width="500px" alt="MacBook Air">
                <p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">The most loved Mac is about to make you fall in love all over again. Available in silver, space gray, and gold, the new thinner and lighter MacBook Air features a brilliant Retina display, Touch ID, the latest-generation keyboard, and a Force Touch trackpad. The iconic wedge is created from 100 percent recycled aluminum, making it the greenest Mac ever.1 And with all-day battery life, MacBook Air is your perfectly portable, do-it-all notebook.<br>&nbsp;</p>

                <h2><i>The MacBook Pro</i></h2>
                <img src=https://mattraimondi.com/webdesign/img/macbookpro.jpg width="500px" alt="MacBook Pro">
                <p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">MacBook Pro elevates the notebook to a whole new level of performance and portability. Wherever your ideas take you, you’ll get there faster than ever with high‑performance processors and memory, advanced graphics, blazing‑fast storage, and more.<br>&nbsp;</p>
